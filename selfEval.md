# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    -Probably a 6-7 out of 10. I need to spend more time with the ideas in this lesson.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    -If we're talking about && and ||, I feel pretty confident. Maybe even a 10/10.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    -I feel minorly shaky on them, but mostly because of syntax.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    -I spent a good three hours on it because I wanted to be sure I understood the material. It lined up with my time estimate because it usually takes me a while to "get" these kinds of ideas.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    -Writing and rewriting syntax for if statments and objects/arrays. I have allocated basically this entire weekend to finish homework and practice these things.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    -I don't think I have specific questions - I just need to practice these ideas more to get muscle memory.
